\paperheading{2D Linear Systems}

Combine the following equations to find the values of $x$ and $y$ assuming
that $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ are given constants. Once you
have your answer write it in determinated format. What are the conditions
under which there is no solution?

$$
\eqalign{
Ax + By &= \alpha \cr
Cx + Dy &= \beta \cr
}
$$

\paperheading{3D Linear Systems}

Combine the following equations to find the values of $x$, $y$ and $z$ just as
before. Once you have your answer write it in determinated format. What are
the conditions under which there is no solution?

$$
\eqalign{
Ax + By + Cz &= \alpha \cr
Dx + Ey + Fz &= \beta \cr
Gx + Hy + Iz &= \gamma \cr
}
$$

Combine the following equations to find the values of $x$, $y$, $z$ and $w$
just as before. Once you have your answer write it in determinated format.
What are the conditions under which there is no solution?

$$
\eqalign{
Ax + By + Cz + Dw &= \alpha \cr
Ex + Fy + Gz + Hw &= \beta \cr
Ix + Jy + Kz + Lw &= \gamma \cr
Mx + Ny + Oz + Pw &= \delta \cr
}

This is a basic addition and division
$$
2 + 2 = 4 
\q{a}{b}
$$

This is a basic integral
$$
\int_{-2}^2 \sqrt{x+2}  |\;dx =\q{16}{3}
$$


$$
\q{a}{b + \q{c}{d}} + 1
$$

This is a basic way to represent multiplication
$$
a \cdot b \cdot c \cdot d 
$$

$$
a*b*c
$$

This is how you separate lines

$$
\displaylines{
2 + 2 = 4 \cr
2 + 2 = 4 \cr
2 + 2 = 4 \cr
}
$$

and separate lines aligned, with numbering
$$
\eqalign{
2 + 2 &= 4 \cr
2 &= 4 / 2\cr
7 + 2 + 4 &= 13 \cr
7 &+ 2 + 4 = 13 \cr
}
\eqno{(3)}
$$

Finally this is how you do vectors
$$
\sv a = \sv b \x \sv c
$$

You can also write math inline, like this: $2 + 2 = 4$. Inline means that the
math stays within the text of the paragraph instead of breaking out into a
separate display.
